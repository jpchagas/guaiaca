 ## Features

📱 Adding a responsive dashboard layout (for finances),

💾 Creating Firestore collections (e.g. wallets, transactions, couples), or

🎨 Adding a welcome animation / Material UI loading state after login?

🌓 a light/dark mode toggle,

📱 a responsive navigation bar, or

💾 persistent storage using IndexedDB/localStorage for future finance data?

Would you like me to include a dark mode toggle or responsive navigation bar in the next step? It’s easy to integrate with Material UI’s theme system.

Would you like me to also show how to make those menu items highlight the active page (so the user knows which section is open)?

Would you like me to now add a “Dashboard Overview” page showing mock finance data (e.g. income, expenses, and a simple bar chart with MUI + Recharts)?

Would you like the FAB to slide up with animation (like a bottom sheet modal) instead of showing SpeedDialActions?

If you want, I can upgrade this even further to a bottom sheet style modal (slides from bottom like a mobile banking app) — looks super smooth and very app-like.

If you want, the next step can be to turn these dialogs into more advanced forms with inputs, validations, and file upload support — just like a real finance app.

If you want, the next step could be to make these metrics and charts dynamic, reading mock transactions from state or Firestore so it looks like a real financial dashboard.

If you want, the next step could be to integrate this table with FAB dialogs so that adding a transaction manually or via file updates the table live.

Would you like me to now update Transactions.jsx to display these seeded transactions in a Material UI DataGrid table?

If you want, I can also make the “Upload File” actually parse CSV and automatically add transactions so it’s fully functional for your PWA.

Would you like me to make it match your brand theme (green highlights, rounded card edges, etc.) so all your auth screens look unified?

Would you like me to add a bar chart below the pie showing monthly income vs expenses next? It gives a great visual trend.
